// psvm +tab key - shortcut for public static void main(String[] args){   }
// sout +tab key - shorcut for System.out.print();

// example =   \t: paragraph space
// example =  \n: new line
// example =  \": prints double quote " on the console

// examples of string - String b1=shit;


//object = from what i understand it can add specific tasks in java together? or use it to run multiple things?
// examples -

// how to start any java code - public static void main(String[] args){
//                    }
// how to print/run the code you write - System.out.println("");   - quotes for texts - "ln" to make seperate line
// how to print/run the code you write - System.out.print("") have no "ln" and it will write on the same line
//add plus signs inside the print output section to put in specific variable around a text
